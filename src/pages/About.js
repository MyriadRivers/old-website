            Hello.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            My name is Jason. 
            I like making stuff with art, music, and code. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            My interests are human-computer interaction, multimedia art, and bugs. 
            In my free time you might find me making music or doing origami.
            <br />
            <br />
            It's a pleasure to meet you.
