            Hello.
            <br />
            <br />
            My name is Jason.
            I like making stuff with art, music, and code.
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm interested in user interface engineering, web development, human computer interaction, generative music, and insects.
            <br />
            <br />
            It's a pleasure to meet you.
